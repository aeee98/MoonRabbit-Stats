# MoonRabbit-Stats
I wrote this because literally people get confused about things that should be basic. So yes, it is time to read.

All the stats in the game and how to get them.

**ATK** - The base attack stat in the game. On the stats screen you will only see end atk stat after modifiers. This is primarily obtained from ATK levels and some inventory effects on weapons and other equipment.

**Max HP** - The base HP stat in the game. If your HP hits 0 you die. Similar to ATK there are modifiers to HP that can be obtained from various means, and the main way of earning Max HP consistently is through its base stat.

**Max MP** - The MP stat of the game. Used primarily for execution of skills. There is a limited amount of Max MP in the game, you can obtain these through Costumes, Guardian Essences and a new artifact.

**Crit Chance** - Basically your chance to crit. If you crit, your damage modifier is multiplied by the Crit DMG multiplier. The max amount of Crit Chance you can get is 100%, and it is only possible through having a Legendary Ring, all Crit Chance Guardian Essences obtained and all the relevant Crit Chance inventory and equip bonuses through gear.

**Crit Damage** - the multiplier of damage of which you increase damage dealt if you crit. 

**Attack Speed** - Essentially how fast you attack. The base attack speed (100%) is 1 auto attack a second. If you have 500% attack speed for example you attack 5 times a second.

**Movement Speed** - How fast you move. Useful in bosses when dodging mechanics as you cannot autoattack when moving, so getting to position fast is critical to high dps.

**Skill Cast Speed** - It affects 2 things. Firstly it affects the animation lock you have when casting a skill. Secondly it affects how fast certain skills deal damage as they are time based with a pseudo attack speed rather than a fixed amount of attacks.

**DEF** - A factor of which the amount of damage taken is reduced. This is NOT flat damage reduction, it actually scales. This is mostly obtained from costumes.

**Reduced Damage Taken** - A flat damage reduction modifier. There is only one source of this: Guardian Essences.

**MIN/MAX Damage rate** - Every tick of damage has a dice roll between the MIN DMG rate and the MAX DMG rate. Increasing the stats increases the potential of your dice roll. If MIN Damage is higher than MAX damage, you will only get the MAX damage rate (aka lower than MIN Damage rate).

**HP Recovery/sec**|**Max HP Percent Recovery/sec**|**MP Recovery/sec**|**Max MP Recovery/sec** - Literally what it says on the paper. Don't look further there is almost nowhere you can get this stat.

**HP Recovery/kill**|**Max HP Percent Recovery/kill**|**MP Recovery/kill**|**Max MP Recovery/kill** - see the previous stat. It is the same thing, except it triggers whenever a mob dies. Note that even if Nia kills it, you still get the bonus.

**HP Recovery Rate** | **MP Recovery Rate** - Pointless stats, just ignore as there is no real way to improve this at all.

**Increased EXP Gain** | **Increased Gold Gain** - increases the amount of exp/gold gained from mobs when they die. Does NOT affect gains from the clear reward from quests and dungeons.

**Increased Item Drop Rate** | **Increased Weapon Enhancer** | **Increased Skill Enhancer Drop** - Same as EXP/Gold

**Increased (insert element here) Level** - All skills of the mentioned element are increased by that amount stated. If it states all then all skill levels are increased instead.

**Increased DMG Dealt** - basic damage increment modifier. You do (100% + Increased DMG dealt) extra damage.

**Increased Element DMG** - If the skill or attack type is of that element, you further do (100% + Increased Element DMG dealt).

**Increase All Element DMG** - After all the elemental dmg is calculated you do a further (100% + Increased all element damage dealt) damage if it is an attack tied to an element (ie: Any skill that is not a basic attack).

**Increase DMG Dealt to Normal Monsters/Boss** - Deal (100% + stat) extra damage to that monster type.

**Cooldown speed** - It is an inverse cooldown reduction. If you have 110% Cooldown Speed your cooldowns are about 90.9% of the original (100/110%)

**Increased Break State Duration** - It will only become a negative number because the only stat is from a ring that penalises the duration, but what it does is increase or reduce the time alloted to break when the boss is broken.

**Break Gauge Loss Rate Up** - Increase the amount of Break Gauge amount broken when a CC occurs.

**Increased Normal Attack DMG** - Increases the amount of damage dealt by autoattacks. Remember that it is 100% + this stat.

**DEF Penatration** - Ignores a certain amount of enemy DEF when dealing damage. There hasn't been any known calculations for DEF, so just get more when you get them.

**Increased Skill DMG** - Increases the damage that stems from the skill. This only affects the skill's multiplier.


Now for the additional bits.

1. If there is an asterisk (\*) or more, each asterisk indicates an additional time numbers increase.

For example, if you have 1000 ATK, 10000% ATK and 130% ATK\*, your total ATK becomes 1000 * 10000% * 130% = 130K attack.

2. Anything stating as final is the final incremenet at the end of the calculation. They are ALWAYS 100% + its stated percentage. Due to the nature of the calculations, you might as well treat it as another modifier.

3. Everything is multipicative. Your total damage goes through EVERYTHING that is related to damage row by row.

4. Stats that affects your base stat is not shown. Do the math yourself.

5. Inventory effects are permanent whereas equip effects only work when it is equipped.

6. Anything within the same modifier is additive. If you have a weapon that gives 100% atk on inventory effect, and equipping gives 130% atk, you gain +230% ATK. 

6a. The only exception to this rule is the Moonrabbit stat ratio on Nia's Awakenings, which only proc once despite it looking like an inventory effect.
